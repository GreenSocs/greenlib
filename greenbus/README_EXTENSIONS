You can extend the generic protocol by creating a new transaction container
calss and putting it into the /transport directory tree.

Please see /transport/PLB/PLB.h for an example.

Note that your extended transaction definition header must have exactly
the same name than the transport/subdirectory name. Then you can compile
with

> make EXTENSION=MyTransaction

whereby MyTransaction is defined in the file

/greenbus/transport/MyTransaction/MyTransaction.h.

In your models, no changes are necessary as long as they do a

#include "greenbus/transport/GP/GP.h"

Have fun.
