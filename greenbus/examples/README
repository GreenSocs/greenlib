When using the Makefiles, you can use the following switches:

Compile with USE_STATIC_CASTS:
> make STATIC=yes

Compile with an extended transaction type:
> make EXTENSION=PLB

(this example uses the PLB transaction container)


For example, if you want to compile the simplebus example with static cast
class hierarchy and PLB transactions, type:

> cd examples/simplebus
> make STATIC=yes EXTENSION=PLB

Note that the EXTENSION macro will overwrite #include "transport/GP/GP.h". 
In the GP.h file then the correct extended transaction definition will
be included (e.g. transport/PLB/PLB.h).

Thus, in your sourcecode you can always include GP.h and then overwrite
it by giving the define at make time
